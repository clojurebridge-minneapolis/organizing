# ClojureBridge Minneapolis Hangout Notes 3/7

## tl;dr / Executive summary

* Progress on sponsorship, content, and marketing!
* Attendees: Anne, Laurie, Greg, Brian, Tom
* Next organizers meeting 2014-03-14 4:30pm CST (ask **tmarble** for a Google Hangout invite!)
  * _note_ Tom will en route back to MSP and will miss this meeting

## Done/Decided

* Added Anne to the github team!
* The team will commit to signing the DevJam waiver (so we can offer adult beverages)
* We reviewed the lunch quote from [Sucre & Sel](http://www.sucre-sel.com/) -- yummy and less expensive than we thought!
* We will do two "ticket releases" like for [minnedemo](http://minnestar.org/minnedemo/) for the purpose of guaging interest, developing buzz, and giving us time to handle too many or too few signups
* Don't forget to [hop on IRC](../../FAQ.md) to chat with the team in real time
* We talked about dividing up the tasks and some ideas for each one --> which have turned into issues...
