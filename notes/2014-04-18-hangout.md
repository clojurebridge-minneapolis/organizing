# ClojureBridge Minneapolis Hangout Notes 4/18

## tl;dr / Executive summary

* Meet at 4pm Next Friday 4/25 @ Code42 to work through the curriculum
  * Let **tmarble** know if you can't attend in person, but would like to join via hangout
* EventBrite opens for signup next week!
* Attendees: Chris, Ryan, Nic, Greg, Tom

## Done/Decided

* The ClojureBridge Minneapolis site has been updated (thanks Jamie!)
  * http://www.clojurebridge.org/events/2014-05-16-minneapolis-mn

## TODOs

Most of the TODO's are github [issues](https://github.com/clojurebridge-minneapolis/organizing/issues)

* Everyone - let's rethink the curriculum with these ideas in mind (from RailsBridge and ClojureBridge Durham):
  * Let's make sure that the end goal is not *too* ambitious.. We can always do more if all the students get done.
  * Let's focus mainly on time in small groups, at "work stations" (tables where students will focus on a given module) instead of lecture format.
  * Let's plan for early success (get to a simple program right away -- not wait until step 6)!

* Take notes and check in ideas as you go to [curriculum_notes](https://github.com/clojurebridge-minneapolis/organizing/tree/master/curriculum_notes/)
