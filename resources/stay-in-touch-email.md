I am so glad you are interested in the event! This will be our last event for 2015, but we are hoping to schedule more next year. These dates are TBA. We also host coding sessions at local coffee shops open to everyone. These are usually informational and the invitations are sent out via twitter. 

I would suggest:

- Following us on twitter: https://twitter.com/ClojureBridgeMN (good for both impromptu gatherings and workshops)
- Keep an eye on our website, specifically the calendar: http://clojurebridgemn.org/
- Keep an eye on the national site: http://www.clojurebridge.org/
- Go through the curriculum on your own: https://github.com/clojurebridge-minneapolis/installfest (links there to the installfest and track1 and track2 curriculum). 
- If you run into any issues going through the curriculum on your own, you can jump into our IRC channel to ask questions: #clojure.mn. (If you need, we can help you use IRC over email too.)

We are hoping to create a mailing list for people interested in getting updates about the event, but that is not yet created. Hopefully the other means of following us are enough in the mean time. 

Let me know if you have any further questions!
