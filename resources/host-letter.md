You have agreed to host a ClojureBridge MN workshop! We are so excited
to be collaborating with you for this event. This will be our 5th
event and we have learned a few things along the way that help make
the collaboration with the hosts go smoothly.

#### What you can expect from us:

* A point of contact on our board to coordinate with before the event
  and during the event.
  
* To leave the space as clean as we found it.

* Is there anything we can add to the above to make this work better
  for you/your locale?

#### Need from you:

* Point of contact from your location that can be our point of contact
  before and our liaison during the event.

* Only registered event members in the space during the event. We
 welcome your employees to register for the event as students (as long
 as they meet the target audience) or volunteers, we only ask that
 they sign up before hand. The most important reason for this is we
 have a duty to create a safe environment that for our
 guests. Registered students and volunteers see the [Code of
 Conduct](ta-meeting-notes.md) and this helps us ensure they are
 aligned with the goals of the workshop. We are aware this is a
 workplace, so it is understandable that employees may need to stop by
 for there stuff etc. We only ask that if they linger too long you
 help us ask them to find an new place to work.
