#ClojureBridge MN - TA Resources

###Code of Conduct

+ http://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct/gray-area.html

####Real Examples/Point to Highlight
+ Please do not hand your CV to attendees
+ Don't comment on attendees' clothing
+ Clear Examples - Grabbing keyboards - you know you will want to, don't do it. If you have to, ask first. It is okay, if the student's environment is completely borked or something is going wrong with their install fest. Typing for them for them undermines the goal of the workshop. Telling them what to type, without explaining what it means or does, also undermines the goal of the workshop.
+ Clear Examples - ```Do not ask anyone out on a date.```
+ Gray area - ```If you are not sure if something is appropriate behavior, it probably isn’t.```
+ Gray area - ```If you didn’t realize that your behavior would have a negative impact, that is your responsibility. Problems happen when we presume that our way of being is ok with everyone, when we assume that our way of thinking or behaving is the norm. This is particularly problematic when the other person is less empowered or is a member of a minority group.```
+ What if a student wants to get in touch with a TA after the event to get help? ```A: Please, do not hand out your personal contact information. You can give out the info@clojurebridgemn.org email.
All students can be added to our bridges email list, you should subscribe too: http://lists.info9.net/mailman/listinfo/clojurebridge-alumni.  
This will be a safe place for them to email and ask technical questions. The code of conduct applies for this list as well.``` 

####TA Tips
+ Listen more than you talk.
+ Let the student completely finish their question, don't anticipate and don't interrupt.
+ Recognize that sometimes people talk through something aloud and it is not really a question. It may not need a response.
+ We will have paper and pens and there will also be white boards available. Prefer drawing, to directly typing on someone's keyboard.
+ We are not assigning TAs to students. We want to create an environment where the students help each other and self organize and TAs are available to answer questions that arise. Be available and appear available, so you are not intimidating to approach. UPDATE: Ryan asked a great question today about the idea of "self organizing". It is likely that some students will feel nervous at the beginning of the workshop, although we want to have the students self organize and help each other, it is very likely that the TAs and volunteers will have to set the mood in the room. It is ok to welcome students over, start the curriculum with them and sit with them etc.

+ We are all at different levels with Clojure and teaching. We need to be as aware of each other as we are of the students. Be proactive about helping your fellow TAs and be open to somebody helping you. At the same time, respect and do not undercut other TAs.
+ There is no pressure for the students to finish. There will be many opportunities for them to finish. Hack nights or a future bridge. 
+ "In Jokes" - Be careful with tech jokes that only TAs in the room know. It is fine to say them, but be ready to explain, so everyone can laugh.
+ Careful with the use of jargon. Sometimes, you might not even know you are doing it. If you here a fellow TA using some term that the student likely doesn't know, ask a clarifying question, "What does X mean?", even if you already know. This is a great way to help students feel more comfortable asking questions and creates a space to explain the meaning of the word.
+ Approach students from the front, don't pop up behind them or hover behind them to try and look at their screen. 
+ If you know a student already knows an answer to another student's question, bring them in to help explain. This brings students together, gives them confidence and an opportunity to better understand the concepts they are learning.
+ UPDATE: Please be conscious of use of pronouns. Pronouns will be printed on badges, but if you are not sure default to 'they'.

####Tracks
Please take notes of the rough spots and give us feedback in any form, pull requests are especially welcome. We hope to have a short debrief or retrospective after the event to go over some of this.

#####Install Fest
https://github.com/clojurebridge-minneapolis/installfest
+ This is now the landing page for all the curriculum. 

#####Track One
https://github.com/clojurebridge-minneapolis/track1-chatter
+ There is a pretty extensive git tutorial in track one. All students will be making commits as they go, so remember that you will have ```git diff``` as a tool.

#####Track Two
https://github.com/clojurebridge-minneapolis/clojure-koans
https://github.com/clojurebridge-minneapolis/track2-functional
