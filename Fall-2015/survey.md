1. _Overall format, the TA's! Fantastic access to talented devs. Venue + location._

1. _I liked all the people available to help and willingness to show more._

###3. What should we change?
1. _Nothing -- great program._
1. _Track 2: add the 'Track 2 functional programming' file to the download Track 2 koans_
1. _As a beginner there were some words that I didn't know what they were (e.g. editor). A brief description would have helped._
1. _Some instructions confusing -- need clarity._
1. _Not sure if it would make a difference, but having an updated guide that is more detailed on where inputs are required (Track 1)._
1. _Some instructions were a little vague for a beginner, also could have used more description of what each command/action does._
1. _Some fo the instruction docs are confusing._
1. _Seems a little strange to refer to half the population as "diversity" bit it makes sense in the tech field._
1. _It would be cool to have some follow-up or next steps activities. Like, what should I do after today?_
1. _Content needs a few tweeks -- told TA's._
1. _The koan exercises are quite long -- maybe hold them between the 2 days._
1. _It was great!_
1. _Maybe more explanation of instructions in Chapter 6._
1. _More direction on what to do after finishing the Track 1 app._
1. _Please continue to make the tutorials more accessible to us "non-computer nerds." There were some missing steps. Mentors helped._
1. _Feel Track 2 covers more territory than is realistic. Felt like trying to fit Track 2 + Track 3 into one, esp. for devs w/o previous Clojure experience. Would have been great to do a modification of the Track 1 app or something -- don't quite feel like I know how a web app is coded in Clojure!_
1. _Day was a little long, particularly with the more thought intensive stuff at the end._
1. _Less self-direction & more forced explanation/interaction._
1. _Would be great to have more women instructors. Last page of the instructions could use more detail._

###4. What else would you like us to know?
- _It was great! Best one yet :)_
- _Thanks! This was awesome!_
- _The Clojure community is great! Thanks for a great event!_
- _Great event. Glad to see folks work towards inclusivity in the tech community._
- _Younger people who grew up on smartphones would find this cool._
- _I am grateful to the organizers and volunteers._
- _It was great and I felt very comfortable._
- _I think Clojure is pretty cool._
- _More events like this. Would also have more talk about data structures._
- _Great Job! Super excited for Track 2!_
- _How do I get connected to the montly get-together? Kudos to Millie, Brian and the other volunteers for making me feel so welcome!_
- _Koans were awesome, but after marathoning through to recursions I was feeling burnt out. That is a lot to absorb at once. Might have even been nice to do install fest 1 week before, koans for homework w/slack channel for discussion, then gather for Track 2 -- or something. Thanks for all our hard work! Learned a lot!_
- _If you're able to wrangle it in the future, all-gender bathrooms would be great, even just signs taped over the visual binary signs._
- _Thank you so much for a great opportunity!_
- _Thanks for organizing this great event!_
