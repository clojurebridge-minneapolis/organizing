##ClojureBridge MN March 2014

### 1. How likely are you to recommend  ClojureBridge workshop to a friend or colleague?
- Very likely - 16
- Somewhat likely - 1 (number 14)

### 2. What was great?
1. _People, clear (mostly) instructions, good food_
2. _Friendly, helpful, mentors!_
3. _I like the pace of level 1_
4.  _Welcoming to people at all experience levels. Event TAs had different experience levels, which was great! Also, the panel was great!_
5. _The enthusiasm. Getting women together to work toward a common goal._
6. _How supportive everyone was._
7. _The amount of support from the TAs. And the food._
8. _I was very happy with the amount of things covered. The environment was supportive/friendly and not as intimidating as I expected._
9. _Organization and coordinating the event. Kudos! Also, plenty of food._
10. _The informal installfest help as well as the kindness and helpfulness of the TAs_
11. _I won a free Clojure Programming Guide._
12. _Good (clear) instructions. Knowledgeable TAs that worked together to get us the answers._
13. _TAs were super helpful and kind!_
14. _Everyone was really welcoming, friend and super helpful_
15. _People getting excited about getting something working and the discussion panel._
16. _The helpful and friendly Tas!_
17. _TAs were super helpful and nice_

###3. What should we change?
1.  _Do more of an initial overview for track 1 - what clojure is used for, it's basic syntax etc. Also, installfest didn't seem necessary - took me ~15 mins. But thanks for the pizza!_
2. _Not sure. Maybe tables to sit at instead?_
3. _It might be better to have a quick 30 minute explaining clojure._
4. _So much food! :)_
5. _Remind people to use IM to communicate. Great idea, but it was forgotten._
6. _Nothing._
7. _With in the material, I suggest milestones - that way concepts are distinct and it allows for breaks in the work-flow/day_
8. _The instructions should be impeccable - when there are typos, assume we don't understand it. Also, when people are finished, talking quietly helps those reading not to become distracted._
9. _Track 2: more explanation of syntax_
10. _I would say that track 2 is for Experienced Programmers versus "experience with programming."_
11. _Clearer and concise instructions for sample coding._
12. _I know people work at different paces (and learn differently), but I think it would be helpful to have some "lecture" on a topic, time for questions, then time to actually make the changes. Short of that, I would encourage participants to read everything in the instructions and type the code (rather than copy/paste). I know this will cause more mistakes, but that's a great way to learn!_
13. _Curriculum has a few typos and it unclear in some spots._
14. _I feel like I didn't learn much at all about Clojure itself. I followed the instructions fine, but wished there was more instructions about what we were actually doing._
15. _A location with tables would make it easier to work together._
16. _The tutorial materials sometimes jump around, doesn't explain enough. Also, for a totally new person, a lot of big concepts. Likely to be a risk of copying and pasting w/out knowing/understanding what you're doing._
17. _Written instructions were confusing - seemed to jump (mini) steps_

### 4. What else would you like us to know?
1. _Thank you! it was great to feel successful so quickly. Too many TAs?_
2. _na_
3. _Practical examples_
4. _A room with actual tables might be nice for collaboration, but everything is donated, so I understand you can't be picky!_
5. _Thank you._
6. _The food was fantastic. - thanks!_
7. _One other suggestion in the material is to link back to previous task - we learned to create a branch and then later it said create a branch - linking to the original explanation would be helpful_
8. _I liked that we could go at our own pace. I like to take my time reading and rereading. I appreciate the format._
9. _Gr8 job!!!_
10. _I really appreciate the effort that was made to accommodate different preferences. (Food, learning styles, etc.)_
11. _More information on bootcamps or trade schools providing certifications or degree programs._
12. _Thank you all so much for organizing this!! It was great. =)_
13. _Thank you!!!! :)_
14. _I liked getting to use git and feel like I have a decent understanding of that!_
15. _na_
16. _Thank you for all the work from the organizers and volunteers!_
17. _:)_

Random handwritten paper survey: (This might be from Brian Dawn regarding Track 2)
- _Agree on a subset of the syntax in the examples to not confuse people_
- _Ensure every feature is preselected before it's used. +1_
- _Simpler threading macro example_
- _Acculomate with clojure limits_
- _Limit column width to 70_
- _Hack time is awesome_
- _Pods, issue with room_

### Millie's Ideas/Summary
- Maybe we should add to the survey who the primary TA was that was helping them. This would help us get a sense of the TAs that were really creating an impact.
- Good git tutorial
- Something for people who want more depth. Links to more information on the web?
- Track one still needs some polishing. (Typos, milestones, how to balance self lead instruction with lecturing, copy pasting ok?, bigger concepts missed?, jumps around)
- Track two framing. Who is this for?
- Location with tables
