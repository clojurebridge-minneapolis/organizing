## ClojureBridge MN Fall November 4-5, 2016

### 1. How likely are you to recommend ClojureBridge workshop to a friend or colleague?
- Very likely = 11
- Somewhat likely = 1
- Neutral = 0
- Somewhat likely = 0
- Very unlikely = 0
- (didn't answer) = 1

### 2. What was great?
1. _This was such an approachable, welcoming, accepting and friendly environment. I was so intimited by the industry and my lack of programming knowledge and this environment was what I needed to get started: thank you! I also loved how it was so hands on w/ TA's, it was great one-to-one learning._
1. _The TA's, students, organizing & inclusion of gender non-conforming and trans people._
1. _It was great to have support from the TA's and immediate assitance when stuck on an issue_
1. _Welcoming of all experience levels. Trying to work on inclusivity. TA's that really wanted to help/approachable. Having food available. Friendly._
1. _A lot of support to work with you one-on-one. Work at your own place._
1. _It was easy to ask questions._
1. _Everything! It was great to get help right away when I had a question_
1. _Yes! Thank you - learned a lot. Perfect amount of instruction for the time alloted. The TA's were wonderful._
1. _TA's were very accessible & knowledgable. Food was great! I feel very knowledgable about Clojure now. Good documentation._
1. _Plenty of TA's, easy to get help._
1. _Self-directed and be able to ask questions when necessary._
1. _It was great how encouraging everyone is who volunteered. Millie's it intro was really well done. Melissa and Brian made my experience smooth._
1. _Lot's of 1:1 help thru the whole track 1 process. Free food!_


### 3. What should we change?
1. _I would love to see the twitter handles on nametags for staying in touch. :)_
1. _Instruction could be more clear. I wish the code we need to change was upfront & then the explanation afterwards._
1. _The directions should be simplified. For the most part it was straightforward, but there were a few areas that need more explanation and direction._
1. _For the directions -- I think they could be more clear (i.e. showing the leiningen picture and then getting into the more detailed things/aspects of the code._
1. _It was really enjoyable and approachable. I like the idea of the panel below to learn more about how Clojure is used in the real world. What companies are using Clojure and for what projects?_
1. _Have more time telling us cool things and less time having us do koans. They're good, but something can do mostly on their own._
1. _On the prompt, please put example by the boxes that don't need to be added into the text editor or terminal_
1. _Some of the instructions could probably use some tweaking, but for the most part went pretty smooth._
1. _A bit less in-class time on Koans (though they are useful). More examples/talks on how people use Clojure in their work._
1. _Slightly more structure for Track 2 - still time on own, but a few more common themes, etc._
1. _Nothing particular._
1. _I'm not sure, it would probably... maybe be nice if there were actually more students. Not sure though. Solidarity or something._
1. _Some of the wording in the documentation. Maybe recommended command prompt programs, my default had a really hard time so I installed another one during the session. More get-to-know-you type of activities._

###4. For future workshops weâ€™re considering having a panel discussion. Please rate (1, 2, 3) 	which topics would be most important to address:

*NOTE: The intent of this question was to rate the top three topics where
1 = most important, 2 = next most important,... Several of the respondents entered 1 for each topic and thus all the raw numbers (or checked boxes) are shown below.*

 - Women developers (only technical roles) = 1 1 3 x 3 1 x 2 3 1 1 1 1
 - Women run businesses/entrepreneurship in tech = 1 1 3 x 1 1 x 3 2 3 1 2 1
 - Next steps into the industry after ClojureBridge = 1 1 3 x 2 3 x 1 3 2 2 1 1
 - Pipeline problem vs. employer attitude - i.e. women are not choosing tech vs.	employer not investing in education/training and attracting diverse candidates = 1 1 3 x 2 x 4 1 1 1 1 1
 - Other =
   * "women & gender nonconforming & trans people"
   * "How to go forward in programming. What other languages to learn."
   * "LGBTQIA" developers

### 5. After each ClojureBridge we add students to an alumni e-mail list to announce upcoming workshops or topics of interest to this community (less than 6 e-mails/year).
- default in = 12
- opt-out = 1

### 6. What else would you like us to know?
1. _Thank you so much for putting this service day together. It meant so much to me and it was a wonderful experience._
1. _This was awesome! Thank you to all the volunteers and TA's._
1. _You are all amazing! This was a great experience. Keep it going!_
1. _Thank you for putting this together!_
1. _This was a great experience for marketers and project managers -- anyone who works with developers. I think it's a step towards bridging the gap between programmers and non-programmers._
1. _ _
1. _Thank you for taking the time to teach me :)_
1. _I may have better/more feedback after I have some tiem to marinate w/everything I leared. An e-mail survey option could help._
1. _I loved ClojureBridge!_
1. _ _
1. _ _
1. _Excellent work people! You created a good environment._
