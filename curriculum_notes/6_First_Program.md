# Curriculum Notes for Module 6.  Making Your First Program

4/5/2014 - Greg
* running on linux with Clojure 1.5.0, Leiningen 2.3.4

* Directory structure after lein new did not have a .gitignore, LICENSE, doc folder
* README.md should be above resources
* src/global_growth has bothe core.clj and web.clj
* lots of Retrieving ... messages before Hello World prints
* Should the Hello ClojureBridge be done in LightTable.  If so then should probably explain about adding the project to the workspace.
* Second run does not need to download all the dependencies
* newest Leiningen adds dependency for Clojure 1.6.0
* client/get "lets try it out"  is that from a REPL or added to main in the program?
* will want to make sure the students know about [Clojure Cheat Sheet](http://clojure.org/cheatsheet)
* Is the delay and dereference worth the complexity?  The list of countries can be cached in the let statement
