###2. What was great?
1. _Hanging out, chatting with people_

1. _Learned a lot, great hands on._
1. _I liked the open environment._
1. _Friendly group, awesome food choices._
1. _The Koans are very interesting._
1. _Having a chance to connect with others in CS in the twin cities._
1. _People welcoming, supportive, fun and easy to get to know and ask for help from._
1. _The knowledgable help and encouragement was exactly what I needed to get me started._
1. _Liked the Koans and how you go at your own pace._

###3. What should we change?
1. _I'd like to see the panelists doing anti-sexist work (like the work of this org) or female developers They were shall I say 'not a good fit'. At least aware that we live in a sexist society and that is felt in the tech community._
1. _Nothing - today was pretty much perfect._
1. _Add one panelist who are actually coding._
1. _Maybe for those who don't know how to much, have a bit more basic info._
1. _Was marketed as an event for women but had a large number of men as TAs and leaders. Need more female programmer volunteers!!!!_
1. _Panel could improve - yes, there were (mostly) women but besides that qualification they at little to offer in terms of actively working towards diverse workforces (gender, race, economic) or coaching on being descriminated as women @ work. Their views on dealing with it didn't feel currente or very intentional. Woman from Vidku offered the best piece when she spoke about empathy but not a pushover and wasn't on the panel._
1. _Maybe better parking? Then venue though was greally good._
1. _Maybe give some links for reference materials / further exercises?_

###4. What else would you like us to know?
1. _I really appreciate you all giving your time today. Please send out an email with more Clojure opportunities!_
1. _Very encouraging, patient TAs, learned a lot!_
1. _I enjoyed it and will definitely be back again._
1. _Felt like a very bro-grammer environment, despite being an event for women._
1. _Very cool - thank you for your time and the great space, food, ppl and experience!_
1. _Denigrating *every* other language so vociferously makes most all other thoughts and opinions quite suspect._
1. _Had fun!_

### Ideas/Summary
- _TBD_
